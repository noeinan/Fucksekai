# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

This is the very first version, therefore it is the only supported version. 

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.0.x   | :x:                |
| 0.0.x   | :x:                |
| < 0.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

Noeinan: Hey there, I don't really know what vulnerability means for this game. 
Resistance to hacking? Having people pull out all the image files and code?
In any case, I guess if there's any of the above, it's above my pay grade.
That would be a problem with the software I'm using to make the game. 
But if there is anything that is serious, you can contact me on discord. 
noeinan#4304. If it's not serious, just message me through GitHub.
